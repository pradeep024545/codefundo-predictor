The best safety against natural disasters is to keep a tab on disaster activity beforehand. You’ll have more time to react if you know a natural disaster is on its way to your location. Disaster Alert keeps you updated with multiple types of disasters happening all over the world in real-time.

List of disaster tracking includes earthquakes, hurricanes, flood, storm, tsunami, and volcano etc. Wildfire is also on thought of implementation. You can get notification of natural disasters near your area, view disasters on an interactive map, and learn more about an active hazard. 

• Data collection – traditionally, data collection was done in the form of paper reports or questionnaires. The development of IT allowed for use of word processors, spreadsheets, and forms to enter data directly into the databases: initially at desktop computers and later online forms for which the data was stored on dedicated servers connected to network. Another increasingly important source of data is remote sensing technologies. In the past, remote sensing data was mostly related to expensive satellite systems and sophisticated geospatial tools (Nayak and Zlatanova, 2008). Sensing technologies are currently undergoing rapid advances, leading to affordable sensors that can communicate wirelessly, often without relying on external power sources, to an emergency Operations Center. Use of them significantly increases situational awareness, often in real time. 

• ML is more concerned about the process of knowledge discovery, (algorithms that analyse data) preferably detached from given dataset characteristics, while DM focuses on extracting and exploiting useful information from available data  (with focus on particular instance of data). 
• ML goal is focused more on reproducing existing knowledge (in order to validate usefulness and correctness of the proposed algorithms), while DM is to discover and exploit new knowledge from the provided dataset. 
• Data sources are of concern of DM: providing efficient data infrastructure in the form of databases and efficient retrieval algorithms is part of DM, while ML typically assumes datasets as input of the algorithms (though some algorithm  specific data structures for efficient data access may be a part of ML). 
• DM requires large amounts of data: large databases’ infrastructure is the concern  of DM, while ML may focus on methods and algorithms that are explicitly designed for the limited available data. 

We will use above specified methods of data collections and data attributions and model training which would be use an API in the app also we like to use to azure service for model training
Real-time disaster tracking.
Notification of disasters near your area.
Easy to use interface
all the updates are taken from official sources.
Also information can be given about places to go if you are caught in trouble
Beforehand solutions can be provided to avoid such disaster 
we will be enable a gps based app to give notifiication about local disaster
